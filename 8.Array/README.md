# Array

1) Write a Program that takes N elements (max. value of N is 100 and N is the float number specified by user) from user, stores data in an array and Calculates the average of those numbers
2) Write a Program that takes n element from user and displays the largest element of an array
3) Write a Program that calculates the standard deviation of 10 data using arrays
4) Write a Program that takes the array of five element and the elements of that array are accessed using pointer
5) Write a Program that adds two matrices using Multidimensional Arrays where the number of rows r and columns c is entered by user (Value of r and c < 100)
6) Write a Program takes two matrices of order r1*c1 and r2*c2 respectively. Then, the program multiplies these two matrices (if possible) and displays it on the screen
7) Write a Program that takes a matrix of order r*c from the user and computes the transpose of the matrix
